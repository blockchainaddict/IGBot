# IGBot
Instagram Bot to automatically like posts with the specified hashtags.

This script will open a Chrome session (selenium), log in to an IG account, search for hashtags of coice and like images. It skips the first 9 posts to avoid liking popular accounts (since it would be less efficient cause they probably won't interact with you).
As long as you donÂ´t run it excessively, it is programmed so you don't get banned (waiting times are random).
It also writes how many times you run it on a text file. If you run it too many times or without waiting at least 20/30 minutes your account might get banned.

The fair use of this script is to avoid wasting time with the mechanical, repetitive and yet necessary task of liking other accounts in order to get noticed and grow yours. Any explotation or excessive use is discouraged.

You'll need Selenium webdriver & Chromedriver.
